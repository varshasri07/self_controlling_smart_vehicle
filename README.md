# self_controlling_smart_vehicle
Unlike human drivers, autonomous cars will be able to operate with the same efficiency and decision making under any situation. Hence, to reduce traffic congestion, front 
collision, provide relaxed travelling experience, provide increased safety and better observe traffic rules, autonomous cars prove to be an ideal solution The report 
proposes a self-driving car model also called autonomous,robotic or driver-less car is one that operates and navigates using its intelligence. The basic idea is to 
develop a car to portray an automated car. The model consists of the following software and hardware components such as CNN (Convolutional neural network), MIT app
inventor, Arduino, and an Ultrasonic sensor.
